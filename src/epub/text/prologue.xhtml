			<h2>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</h2>
			<h3>Or, Christianity Not as a Mystical Teaching but as a New Concept of Life</h3>
			<blockquote epub:type="epigraph">
				<p>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free (John <abbr title="chapter eight" epub:type="z3998:roman">ⅷ.</abbr> 32).</p>
				<p>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell (<abbr class="truncation" title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter ten" epub:type="z3998:roman">ⅹ.</abbr> 28).</p>

			<p>In the year 1884 I wrote a book under the title, <cite>My Religion</cite>. In this book I really expounded what my religion is.</p>
			<p>In expounding my belief in Christ’s teaching, I could not help but express the reason why I do not believe in the ecclesiastic faith, which is generally called Christianity, and why I consider it to be a delusion.</p>
			<p>Among the many deviations of this teaching of Christ, I pointed out the chief deviation, namely, the failure to acknowledge the commandment of non-resistance to evil, which more obviously than any other shows the distortion of Christ’s teaching in the church doctrine.</p>
			<p>I knew very little, like the rest of us, as to what had been done and preached and written in former days on this subject of non-resistance to evil. I knew what had been said on this subject by the fathers of the church, Origen, Tertullian, and others, and I knew also that there have existed certain so-called sects of the Mennonites, Herrnhuters, Quakers, who do not admit for a Christian the use of weapons and who do not enter military service, but what had been done by these so-called sects for the solution of this question was quite unknown to me.</p>
			<p>My book, as I expected, was held back by the Russian censor, but, partly in consequence of my reputation as a writer, partly because it interested people, this book was disseminated in manuscripts and lithographic reprints in Russia and in translations abroad, and called forth, on the one hand, on the part of men who shared my views, a series of references to works written on the subject, and, on the other, a series of criticisms on the thoughts expressed in that book itself.</p>
			<p>Both, together with the historical phenomena of recent times, have made many things clear to me and have brought me to new deductions and conclusions, which I wish to express.</p>
			<p>First I shall tell of the information which I received concerning the history of the question of non-resistance to evil, then of the opinions on this subject which were expressed by ecclesiastic critics, that is, such as profess the Christian religion, and also by laymen, that is, such as do not profess the Christian religion; and finally, those deductions to which I was brought by both and by the historical events of recent times.</p>
